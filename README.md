# ConversationAPI
This is the API that powers VR Therapist (project under development) https://github.com/ayush110/VRTherapist

The general structure of the API:
- Audio input -> text -> gpt-3 -> text -> audio output

I have currently used the Google Cloud Text to Speech and Speech to Text Api's, however due to Unity Google Cloud plugin costing money, I have decided to rebuild this using a different tech stack.
Once finished, I will deploy it onto the cloud and create instructions for others to check out.
